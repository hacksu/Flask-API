# Flask

Flask is a micro-framework for Python which allows you to progromatically control what gets returned from an http server.
It's meant to be easy to use and in my opinion it is.

# Installation

Install python from https://www.python.org/ (the first thing that comes up when you Google for Python). The version shouldn't matter.
Check that you have it installed by running `python -V`
Install `flask` by typing `pip install flask`

Then make a new directory and open it in your editor of choice.
